## Hi there 👋
- I'm a backend engineer at Treehouse Labs (the one with black background and a letter T).
- I'm currently learning the Database Management Systems course on CMU, as I interesting on how a database system works and how to use it properly. It would be greate if you want to join me and learn together as well.
- I'm looking to collaborate on any OSS written in Go or Rust.
